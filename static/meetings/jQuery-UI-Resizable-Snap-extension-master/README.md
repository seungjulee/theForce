Unfortunately, the jQuery UI Resizable plugin does not ship with the snap functionality unlike the jQuery UI Draggable plugin that has this very useful functionality out of the box.

But here comes **jQuery UI Resizable Snap extension** to the rescue! It enhances the jQuery UI Resizable plugin with the same snap functionality that is offered by the jQuery UI Draggable plugin.

**jQuery UI Resizable Snap extension** exposes three options to the jQuery UI Resizable plugin: snap, snapMode, and snapTolerance. For the information on those three options, please refer to the official jQuery UI Draggable plugin documentation at [http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/](http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/).

To see **jQuery UI Resizable Snap extension** in action please check out [this demo](http://fiddle.jshell.net/5xB7S/show/light/).
